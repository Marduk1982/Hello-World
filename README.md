# Hello-World
My first repository
Hello world.  My name is Nick, currently I work in retail and I'm not a huge fan of it.  So I'm excited to start the long journey to discover the career of my dreams. I love computers, technology and the internet in general.  Hopefully with Github and TOP I'll learn what I need to become a great web developer!  When I'm not learning about tech I like to draw/digital paint and play video games with my wonderful fiance.
